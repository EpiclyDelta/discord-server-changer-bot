# Info
This is a discord bot that is designed to nuke a server, without killing everything in it. It's ment to be a stealth nuker.
I made this in my free time while i was looking for bot ideas, and needed to learn about how to manage admin permissions with a bot.

# Risks you run using this code.
You run the risks of:

• Having your discord account termniated
• Having your bot removed.

Please run this only in your own server.

# How does this bot work?

This bot works by getting Administrator permissions via OAuth. From there, you can run commands to edit the server name, server picture, server channels, and more.
Please, if you have 0 experience in python/discord.py, read the comments. If you have errors, you can look them up.

# Note

This bot uses context to read. therefore, please add context to your bot, if you don't know how to, look it up.
